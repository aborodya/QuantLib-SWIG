Changes for QuantLib-SWIG 1.12
==============================

The most notable changes are included below.
A detailed list of changes is available in ChangeLog.txt and at
<https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib-SWIG/milestone/5?closed=1>.

- As announced in last release, obsolete bindings for the Guile,
  MzScheme and OCaml languages were removed.

- When available, setuptools is now used to build the Python
  wrappers. This enables additional functionality, such as building
  binary wheels of the module.

- Add __bool__ method to classes for which __nonzero__ was defined,
  for compatibility with Python 3 (thanks to Anthony Calleja for the
  report).

- Exported FX-swap rate helper and an extended constructor for the OIS
  rate helper (thanks to Wojciech Slusarski).

- Exported Brownian bridge class and a few more methods for the Sobol
  random-number generator (thanks to Roy Zywina).

- Exported OAS calculation, including a Java example (thanks to Bojan
  Nikolic).

- Exported more functionality for fitting methods (thanks to Robin
  Northcott).
